# US-School-Analysis

# I joined files, cleaned the data, and plotted data all to analyze the relations between teacher-to-student ratios

## Findings from the analysis and plots:
* One obvious correlation is that there are more schools where there are greater populations, such as in cities. Another finding I noticed is that in the states with the highest ratios they often only had only one school that stood out as a significantly higher value.
* New York had the third highest quantity of schools but was on the lower end of student-teacher ratios.
* I believe I made the right choices in how I cleaned the data, even in retrospect.
* Illinois and Utah both don't share their teacher counts, thus the student-to-teacher ratio was not available.
* Racial analyses could certainly yield some additionally interesting results.
